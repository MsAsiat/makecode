# makecode

My name is Asiat Adeola Adeniran, I am a graduate of computer Engineering with over 15 years teaching experience in Nigeria and the Middle East. 
I currently work as ICT teacher at GEMS Westminster School, Ras Al Khaimah, UAE.
For me, teaching isn't a job, it's my passion and I enjoy coding
